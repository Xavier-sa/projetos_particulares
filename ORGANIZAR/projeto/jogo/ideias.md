Claro! Aqui estão algumas sugestões adicionais para personagens que podem enriquecer seu jogo e trazer mais diversidade ao enredo:

### 1. **Mercador Goblin Mágico**
- **Prompt:** "A sneaky and cunning goblin merchant, dressed in a patchwork robe with a mix of exotic fabrics and enchanted trinkets. He carries a large, mystical satchel filled with rare items and magical artifacts. His eyes sparkle with greed and intelligence, and he’s always ready to make a deal—no matter how shady. His small, wiry frame is quick, and he always seems to know what the player needs, even before they do. He speaks with a sly smile and offers goods in exchange for secrets or favors. His shop appears wherever there’s a need for supplies, hidden in the shadows or tucked in a corner of the marketplace."

### 2. **Guerreiro Goblin com Sentimentos de Honra**
- **Prompt:** "A noble goblin warrior, unlike his kin, who believes in honor and respect on the battlefield. His armor is a mix of traditional goblin gear and elements of knightly design, decorated with symbols of bravery and valor. He wields a longsword, polished to a reflective shine. His demeanor is serious, and though he is small, he is immensely skilled with his weapon. He fights not for wealth or power, but for the honor of his tribe, and his sense of right and wrong makes him an unlikely but honorable ally—or a foe with a sense of justice."

### 3. **Goblin Caçador de Monstros**
- **Prompt:** "A relentless goblin monster hunter, dressed in a mix of leather and bone armor, designed to withstand harsh environments and protect him from the beasts he hunts. He carries a set of traps, poisons, and a crossbow with custom-made bolts for taking down the toughest of monsters. His eyes are sharp, constantly scanning his surroundings, and his small, muscular build allows him to move quickly and silently. His expression is focused, determined, and shows no fear. He’s not afraid to take on dragons, trolls, or even undead creatures, and his knowledge of monsters is vast."

### 4. **Goblin Alquimista**
- **Prompt:** "A goblin alchemist, wearing a long, tattered robe filled with vials and flasks containing glowing potions. His hands are stained with various concoctions, and his eyes gleam with the excitement of discovery. He carries a large, ornate mortar and pestle, always grinding ingredients for his latest experiment. His laboratory is a cluttered mess of bubbling potions, ancient tomes, and mystical plants. Despite his small size, his knowledge of alchemy and potions is unmatched, and his creations can heal, enhance abilities, or even cause terrible explosions."

### 5. **Goblin Elementalista**
- **Prompt:** "A goblin elemental mage, capable of controlling the elements of fire, water, earth, and air. His robes are embroidered with symbols of the four elements, and his hands crackle with elemental energy. He can summon firestorms, earthquakes, and even summon water creatures to aid him. His staff is topped with a crystal that pulses with elemental energy, and his eyes glow with the power of the elements. His personality is volatile, much like the elements he controls—quick to anger but capable of great loyalty to those who earn his respect."
