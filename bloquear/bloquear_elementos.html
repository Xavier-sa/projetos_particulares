<body>

<p style="border: 20px solid black;background:rgb(223, 207, 177)">Hello World</p>
<div style="border: 20px solid black">Hello World</div>

<p>The P and the DIV elements are both block elements, and they will always start on a new line and take up the full width available (stretches out to the left and right as far as it can).</p>
